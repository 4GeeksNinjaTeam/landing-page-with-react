Technologies: HTML, CSS, JS, React.

Let's build [this landing page](https://github.com/breatheco-de/exercise-landing-page-with-react/blob/master/preview.gif) using React Function Components.
The idea is to split Bootstrap components into different function Components, they'll be all imported in the main component Home.jsx

***Please use Function Components for this***

Note: the Cards have different content, think DRY (Don't repeat yourself) and declare only ***one*** component and use ```props``` to handle different content.

### How to start?

1. Take some minutes to build a strategy, draw it!

![Strategy for building a landing page with react](https://github.com/breatheco-de/exercise-landing-page-with-react/blob/master/strategy.gif?raw=true)

The key of this project is to help you understand how to pick the components that you want to build, you have to think the best way to organize and avoid future errors. What can be re-used? If your code is tuning into something big and hard to understand you probably will need to split into components: `<Jumbotron />`, `<Navbar />`, `<Card />`.

2. Use the React boilerplate.
3. Start building!

That is it! Start coding your first React website.
Have fun!
